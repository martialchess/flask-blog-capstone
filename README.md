# Clean Blog Flask Project

## Overview
This project is a Flask-based implementation of the Clean Blog theme. It demonstrates how to build a dynamic blog using Flask, Jinja templates, and data fetched from an external API. The project features dynamic routing, static asset management, and a modular template structure.

## Features Implemented
- **Dynamic Homepage:** Fetches blog post data from an external JSON API and displays it on the homepage.
- **Individual Post Pages:** Each post can be viewed on its own page with a unique URL.
- **Dynamic Header Images:** The header image changes based on the page being viewed (home, about, contact, or individual post).
- **Template Inheritance:** Uses Jinja includes for navigation, header, and footer for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.
- **Navigation:** All navigation links use Flask's `url_for` for robust, route-safe linking.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
- **Static vs. Dynamic Paths:** Learned the importance of using absolute paths (with `url_for('static', ...)`) for static assets to avoid issues with relative paths, especially on dynamic routes like `/post/<id>`.
- **Data Handling:** Adjusted data access from object attributes to dictionary keys to match the structure of the fetched JSON.
- **Template Context:** Ensured that variables (like `header_image` and `post`) are passed correctly to templates for dynamic rendering.
- **Debugging 404s:** Resolved issues with missing routes and incorrect template links.

## Real-World Use Cases
- Personal or company blogs
- News or article websites
- Educational content platforms
- Portfolio sites with blog sections

## Future Plans
- **Contact Form Functionality:**
  - Make the contact form work by handling POST requests in Flask.
  - Validate and process form data.
  - Send emails using Python's `smtplib`.
- **Advanced Forms:**
  - Integrate Flask-WTForms for robust form handling and validation.
  - Add CSRF protection and better error handling.
- **Admin Interface:**
  - Add an admin panel for creating, editing, and deleting posts.
- **User Authentication:**
  - Allow users to register, log in, and comment on posts.
- **Deployment:**
  - Prepare the app for deployment on platforms like Heroku or PythonAnywhere.

## Obstacles Overcome
- Fixed issues with static asset loading on dynamic routes.
- Debugged and corrected data access patterns for API-fetched content.
- Improved template structure for maintainability.

## Things Learned
- The importance of absolute vs. relative paths in web development.
- How Flask's `url_for` helps avoid path issues.
- How to pass and use dynamic data in Jinja templates.
- The value of modular, reusable template components.

## How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install flask requests`
2. Run the app: `python main.py`
3. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
